                    <h2>Looking For A CO-OP or Internship Position As A Game Developer</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello, My name is Rahmel Church Jr. and I am a second year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology(RIT).
                        I am currently majoring in Game Design/Development and I aspire to become a game developer in the future.
                        I want to create games that people can enjoy, games that help people get into a better mood, and make them feel happy.
                        Below are some projects that I have worked on. Hopefully, you enjoy them. Thank you for visiting.
                    </p>
