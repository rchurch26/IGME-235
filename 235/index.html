                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Rahmel Church Jr., and I am a second year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology(RIT).
                    I am currently majoring in Game Design/Development and with this class I hope to improve my JavaScript skills.
                    I am also looking forward to creating a well designed and presentable portfolio. I enjoy playing video games like First-Person Shooters, Adventure, Action, and Sports games.
                    I also enjoy playing the sports of Football, Boxing, and Basketball and I enjoy watching anime(Favorite: Hajime no Ippo).
                    After I graduate, I would like to go striaght into the game industry and work as a game developer for a game development company.
                    I really want to work on and create games that people can enjoy.
                </p>
