    <p>Game Title: Asteriods PIXIJS Style(I guess... it's a work in progress)</p>
    <p>Created by: Rahmel Church Jr. Major: Game Design/Development Year: 2nd Year</p>
    <p>Skill Set: Javascript, C#</p>
    <p>My game will be basically a remake of the classic game asteroids. 
        It will be colored and will make use of shape creation with PIXIJS.
        No need for sprites.</p>
    <p>Genre: Action Survival Shooter</p>
    <p>Platform: Web and Mobile</p>
    <p>Story: The game is abstract.</p>
    <p>Aesthetics: The game takes place in space so there will be stars all around.</p>
    <p>Gameplay: The player will be able to do all the controls of the classic Asteriods. 
        They can move the ship around and spin their ship 360 degrees while shooting Asteriods
     that break apart when shot until they're fully destroyed.</p>

    <p>Recreating asteroids was a massive struggle and I unfortunately couldn't even finish the game.
        I was able to get some of the core game to work a little bit. The ship moves based on where the user looks and fires where the user looks.
        You use the left and right arrow keys to turn the ship and the arrow key to move the ship forward.
        You click to shoot but unfortunately I was unable to add the hyperspace feature which allows the player to pop out of a pinch.
        Another error you may notice is that the asteroids kind of strictly spawn from the bottom of the screen.
        This is due to me struggling with have them spawn all around the screen. Hitboxes are kind of messed up as well, especially with the large asteroids.
        The asteroids don't split in the right spot either(or maybe they don't split at all). I was also unable to add the flying ship that shoots across the screen.
        <br>
        Overall, this project wasn't the success I hoped for. I really thought I would be able to complete this and tried my hardest but couldn't. Still I hope you find some way to enjoy it.
